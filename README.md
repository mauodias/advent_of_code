# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code solutions! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, starting from the year 2024, but also including any previous solutions I implement.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. It's a great way to improve your coding skills, learn new algorithms, and have fun with the programming community.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each year will have its own directory, and within each year, there will be subdirectories for each day's challenge. In case I decide to revisit a previous year, I'll create a new directory for that year. Also, if I try to solve a challenge multiple times, I'll create a new directory within the day's directory.

advent_of_code/

│ └── ... 
├── 2023/ 
│ ├── day01/ 
│ ├── day02/ 
│ └── ... 
└── ...
```

## How to Run

Each solution will have its own instructions on how to run it, typically in a `README.md` file within the day's directory. I'm a Python developer, so I may fallback to Python for some of the challenges, but I'll try to use different languages to keep things interesting.

## Contact

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.

Happy coding!
